      <h3>The Need for Clout & Validation</h3>
      <div id="profileContainer">

      <p>Though stan twitter is an awesome place to find communities with similar interests,
        and a great way to find new online friends, it also poses many negative interactions.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the need for validation through retweets, replies and likes should be talked about.</p>
      <div id="fourColumnContainer">
        <div class="stanImage">
          <img src="images/taylor2.jpeg" alt="image" style="width:100%;">

        </div>
      </div>
      <p>A lot of the time, stans are just looking to get "noticed" by their idols, or just want to gain as much clout as possible
      by wanting more and more rts and likes</p>
      <h3>Is This Behavior Harmful?</h3>
      <p>The short answer is yes. Being a stan on twitter can be mentally tiring. </p>
      <p>"Why am I not getting as many likes? Why does nobody want
      to retweet my content? Is it good enough? Will I ever get noticed by my idol?"</p>
      <div id="fourColumnContainer">
        <div class="stanImage">
          <img src="images/harry.png" alt="image" style="width:100%;">
        </div>
        <div class="stanImage">

        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Ultimately, a lot of individuals' self esteem and "worthiness" is based on how much engagement or interactions tweets are getting, which is
          extremely troubling. </p>
        <p>Though this may not be the case for every individual on Twitter, it is prominent specifically on Stan Twitter, due
        to the expectations of gaining likes, retweets, comments etc. </p>
        <p>Being a "stan" compared to being a casual fan is clearly very different and the impact it has on individuals can, at times, be concerning.</p>
